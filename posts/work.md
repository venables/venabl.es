## How I got here

Early in childhood (way back in the 1900s), I cut my teeth in software by writing a fake MS-DOS emulator and installing it across my school's computer network.  The software would work as expected most of the time, and randomly cause mayhem. My sole intention was trolling my teachers. Watching them scramble to try and figure out _what the hell was going on_, I had an epiphany: I absolutely loved watching people use my software.  I knew right then that I wanted to build products for real people.

I spent the next several years pushing the limits of computer systems, dissecting products, and finding the edges of software. I quickly graduated to writing apps to crack AOL and other popular software (inspired by [AOHell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOHell)), even going so far building a web service dedicated to cracking services like [NetZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetZero) to get people free dial-up internet without ads.  People absolutely loved it, and it felt f***ing incredible.  I expanded my reach by building games on graphing calculators and selling them to my classmates.

In college, I built an unlimited photo-sharing website (before the facebook existed) to let students share their photos from study-abroad programs with their family and friends back home. Once facebook arrived, I realized I was thinking too small, and clearly not monetizing enough.

I began to focus on the business side of software, eventually building and selling several products. This only served to further my unsatiable desire for building and growing software products.

And, while I've taken a windy road along the way, my goal still remains the same to this day:

Build and sell great software that people love to use.
