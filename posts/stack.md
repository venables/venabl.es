I've changed stacks for this site several times over the years, from static HTML, to Ruby, to JS, back to Ruby, and now:

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using Typescript, hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).  I don't care that Vercel is "expensive", it's a dream to work with.  And Next for building static content, like it was originally intended.  The dream.
* [StartKit](https://startkit.dev) for the Next.js boilerplate. I wrote it, so I'm biased. But it got me running quickly and lets me git pull the latest and greatest with no headaches.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling. I have too much love for Tailwind.
* [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev) for markdown content. I previously used
  [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) but Contentlayer was just too easy to use.

I once wrote that "we've gone too far" with all the tech needed to host a static
site like this. I still believe that to an extend, but I love to write in
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and I love how this
site is built. So I may be a hypocrite, but I'm a happy hypocrite.
