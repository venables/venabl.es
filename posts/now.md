* Probably playing basketball with my kids whenever it's not snowing.
* Spending my days and evenings trying to build something incredible at [Catena Labs](https://catena.xyz).
* Exercising. A lot.
* Reading [Project Hail Mary](https://www.amazon.com/Project-Hail-Mary-Andy-Weir/dp/0593135202).
* Contemplating the mysteries of the universe. Feeling small. And having a boring mid-life crisis.
