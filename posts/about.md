I love to write software that helps people live happier, healthier lives.  In my free time, I created [jog.fm](https://jog.fm) and [songbpm.com](https://songbpm.com), which help a million unique people per month improve their health and fitness.

Most recently, I co-founded [Catena Labs](https://catena.xyz), building the tools to help bring AI to every app.

Prior to that, I founded [M2 Labs](https://m2.xyz), a web3 dev shop dedicated to building out cross-chain dApps to help demystify crypto.  We co-authored the [Verite](https://verite.id) decentralized identity protocol which is being used by Block (formerly Square), Polygon, Circle and many others.

I also founded [Vested](https://vested.co), a secondary marketplace for employee equity.

Before that, I was an early executive of [Circle](https://circle.com), where I helped grow the company from 6-people in a room to a multi-billion dollar valuation. I was responsible for all consumer-facing products, including our highly successful Circle Pay and Circle Invest apps, as well as helping to create the [USDC stablecoin](https://www.circle.com/usdc).
