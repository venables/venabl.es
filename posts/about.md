Hi, my name is Matt Venables. I'm a dad, husband, software engineer, and entrepreneur living in Boston, Massachusetts.

I'm currently the co-founder and CTO of [Catena Labs](https://catena.xyz), a product studio building tools to help bring AI to every app.

I love to write software that helps people live happier, healthier lives. In my free time, I created [jog.fm](https://jog.fm) and [songbpm.com](https://songbpm.com), which help over a million unique people per month improve their health and fitness.

Prior to that, I founded [M2 Labs](https://m2.xyz), a web3 dev shop dedicated to building out cross-chain dApps to help demystify crypto. We co-authored the [Verite](https://www.circle.com/en/verite) decentralized identity standard which is being used by Block (formerly Square), Polygon, Circle, Ledger, MetaMask, Coinbase, Solana, and many others.

I founded [Vested](https://vested.co) to help employees understand and maximize the value of their equity compensation.

Before that, I was an early executive of [Circle](https://circle.com), where I helped grow the company from 6 people to a multi-billion dollar powerhouse. At Circle, I was responsible for all consumer-facing products, including our highly successful Circle Pay and Circle Invest apps, as well as helping to create the [USDC stablecoin](https://www.circle.com/usdc).

Most of all, I am always learning, evolving, and trying to be better every day.
