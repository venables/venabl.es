I am a product-focused engineer, entrepreneur, advisor, and angel investor with a successful history of building groundbreaking experiences in Web3 and AI.

My passion is creating **intuitively obvious** software that makes the world a better place. And to do it in an economically sustainable way.  Most recently, I co-founded [Catena Labs](https://catena.xyz) to build tools to help unleash the power of crypto and AI in every app.

I write and speak about software, business, crypto, and AI.
