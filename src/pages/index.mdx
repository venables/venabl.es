I build **decentralized** web and mobile products.

I am co-founder and CTO of [Catena Labs](https://catena.xyz), where we're using decentralized identity and stablecoins to give AI agents superpowers. Before Catena, I was early at [Circle](https://circle.com) where I helped create the **USDC stablecoin**, which has a market cap of [<USDCSupply />](https://usdc.cool)

I'm constantly building and learning. I am somewhat obsessed with decentralization, hydration, fitness, AI, self sovereign identity and data, cryptography, philosophy, and the future of the web. And I am an optimist.
